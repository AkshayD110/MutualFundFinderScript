# MutualFundFinderScript
Script written in python to find the most recommended Mutual funds.

This script checks for the most recommended Mutual funds (which are kept in a data sheet currently), and looks up for the most suggested mutual fund.

Basically, the idea comes from the fact that there are set of funds recommended by various researchers every week.
It is difficult to keep a track of who recommended what and when.
This small script helps with the same.
